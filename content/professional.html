        <h1>Recommended Reading</h1>

        <h2>Technical Books</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Code Complete, 2nd Edition</i> by Steve McConnell.  Contains advice that every working programmer should know.  All graduating 
              seniors from a computer science program should be required to read this book prior to starting their first job.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>The C Programming Language</i> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.  This book is a model of what a programming language book
              should be.  It is concise (about 250 pages including a formal grammar of the C language), clear and, frankly, fun to read.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Algorithmics</i> by David Harel.  Algorithms are the heart of programming.  This book explores topics such as data structures,
              fundamental algorithms, complexity, and Turing machines in an accessible and enjoyable manner.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Non-Technical Books</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allen. Very popular as a productivity methodology among programmers; following only a few key
              principles of the book can be sufficient to get (and keep) yourself organized.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> by Roger Penrose.  Penrose is a contemporary of Hawking, and writes an incredible book that traces
              the underpinnings of computers and the human mind--from Calculus and Quantum Physics to Neurobiology--in an attempt to answer the
              question of whether artificial intelligence in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">strong</a> sense is possible 
              (spoiler: Penrose doesn't think so).  It's a fascinating read written at a non-technical level.
