          <h2>Hiking</h2>

            My parents often took my brother and me hiking as children, an activity that I generally found distasteful at the time.  
            Now, however, I'm grateful to them for exposing me to nature as a child: 
            After spending my work week in front of a computer, it's rejuvenating
            to lose myself in the woods for a while.  Hiking is exercise, but it is more importantly an opportunity to reconnect with the 
            natural world and with myself.  It is a time to be present and notice my surroundings.  I've collected links to a few locations
            where I commonly hike near my home, and some places where I've travelled that have particularly inspired me.

            <h2>Around Southeast Michigan</h2>

              <li>
                <a href="http://www.metroparks.com/Kensington-Metropark">Kensington Metropark</a> has a nature study area offering
                hikes of a few miles.  White-tailed deer, chickadees, and cranes are common, and the loop around Wildwing Lake 
                has some rewarding views.  
              </li>          
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.metroparks.com/Indian-Springs-Metropark">Indian Springs Metropark</a> contains the headwaters of the Huron
                River and several miles of enjoyable hiking.  Particularly striking are the large number of 
                <a href="http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/mound_ants">Allegheny ant mounds</a> rising from the ground along the 
                trails like cities hugging a river bank.

                <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?type=SPRK&amp;id=484">Waterloo-Pinckney Recreation Areas</a> are actually 
                two adjacent parks.  There is a 36 mile trail from Waterloo Recreation Area to Pinckney Recreation Area, making this one of the
                only places to go backpacking in southern Michigan.

                 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/slbe/index.htm">Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore</a> will transform your image of Michigan.  Hiking
                 over sand dunes for miles in anticipation of the sight of majestic Lake Michigan is challenging: the summer heat makes this feel like
                 an excursion in the desert.

               <li>
                 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> is one of the most beautiful National Parks. 
                 From hiking through dense woods to reach serene Rainbow Falls, scrambling over steep boulders to reach the incredible panorama atop Chimney
                 Tops, or walking along a ledge only a few feet wide on the Alum Cave Bluffs trail while holding onto a wire bolted into the mountainside,
                 the Smoky Mountains are a hiker's paradise.
               </li>   
               <li>
                 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm">Yellowstone National Park</a> is the first National Park and one of the most popular.  The awe one feels at the incredible display of geysers and hot springs dotting the park is matched only by the reward
                 of viewing herds of wild bison on a hike in the back country.
               </li>
               <li>
                 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National Park</a> is a gorgeous desert park with beautiful flora (the eponymous

            The first house that my wife and I bought together came with a small grass lot and no landscaping.  Over the course of a few years,
            I slowly added beds around the house and planted perennials.  I found working outside in the dirt and among plants a welcome respite
            from my day-to-day experience in an office.   As such, I started exploring gardening as a proper hobby, attending classes sponsored 
            by the Michigan State Extension service, reading books, and slowly adding to the landscape around our home.             
          </p>

          <p><img src="/image/monarch.JPG" height=45% width=45% class="img-top-left" alt="Monarch on Black-eyed Susan" title="Monarch on Black-eyed Susan"/>
            Our garden is still very much a work-in-progress, but currently consists of four distinct areas: A shade garden populated by hostas, 
            coral bells, black snakeroot, and astilbe; a walkway flanked by yarrow, creeping thyme, silver mound, salvia, and creeping phlox; a circular bed hosting
            black-eyed susan, asters, and a rose bush; and a full-sun border with catmint, bee balm, geraniums, and speedwell.  As we grow the garden,
            we're considering the addition of native plants to help support local biodiversity.

           Given my interest in hiking and the outdoors, I am deeply committed to conservation efforts to preserve and restore native landscapes for future generations.  
           To this end, I have volunteered at <a href="http://www.livingstonlandconservancy.org/">Livingston Land Conservancy's</a> Pasinski Preserve in Oceola Township, 
           helping to clear trails to provide access to the interior of the preserve; I've participated in workdays with the Michigan DNR's 
           <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_10871-34686--,00.html">State Park Stewardship Program</a>, pulling invasive weeds such as spotted knapweed
           and garlic mustard; and I've attended classes and field experiences with the  
           <a href="http://msue.anr.msu.edu/program/info/conservation_stewards_program">Michigan Conservation Stewards Program</a>
           to learn more about conservation, plant identification, and ecology.

            It was a lifelong dream of my Dad's to travel to Poland, the birthplace
            of his grandparents.  We travelled there in 1990, beginning an
            annual tradition of family trips that exposed me to diverse cultures and
            natural wonders.  
          </p>
  
          <p> As an adult, I've been fortunate to continue travelling 
            to beautiful locations in Michigan, the United States, and across the world.
            With three young children, my wife and I don't travel as often as we would
            like, but we hope to share our love of travel with our kids as they grow up.
          </p>

          <h2>Reading</h2>
          <div><p>When reading for pleasure, I tend to favor novels over works of non-fiction.

          <ul>
          <li><i>The Road</i>, by Cormac McCarthy</li>

          <h2>Board Games</h2>
          <div>        
            <h3>Go</h3>

            <p>
            I became aware of Go while watching Aronofsky's film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/">Pi</a>.  Go 
            (or weiqi in Chinese, baduk in Korean) is an ancient game of strategy.  Two players 
            alternate placing white and black stones on a 19-by-19 grid with the objective of surrounding as much territory
            on the board as possible.  When a group of stones is completely surrounded by opposing stones, they are captured 
            and removed from the board.  The elegance of Go is in the complex strategy that develops from such simple rules. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Unlike chess, no computer program has yet been written that can challenge the strongest professional players.
            This is partly due to the immense number of possible game states inherent in a 19-by-19 board: exhaustive search by a computer for 
            the best move to make is simply not possible in Go as it is in other board games.  Some have claimed that no two games of 
            Go have ever been identical.
            </p>

            <p>
            Go is most enjoyable played in person with a friend, but there exist many resources to play Go on the computer,
            including <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">Kiseido Go Server</a>, <a href="http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet">Internet Go Server</a>,
            and <a href="https://online-go.com/">Online Go Server</a>.  The 
            <a href="http://www.usgo.org/">American Go Association</a> sponsors local clubs and tournaments, which provides another
            avenue of play.
            </p>

            <h3>Other Favorites</h3>
            <div>
             <p>
             A group of friends and I meet once or twice a month for a game night, where we play a variety of competitive and cooperative board games.
             Some of my favorites from our rotation include:

          <h2>Sundry</h2>
          <div>
          <h3>Music</h3> 
          <p> I play acoustic guitar and drums, poorly.  When I was in college,
              I took lessons from a friend on music theory and technique; I enjoyed
              learning the theory, devising chord progressions, and dabbling 
              with recording, but I never bothered to learn how to play <i>real</i>
              songs.  Nevertheless I briefly had ambitions to become a songwriter,
              even writing several songs for Lauren.  She married me anyway.
          </p>
          <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
          <p>
              For the first few years of college, rock climbing was a passion of mine.
              I trained regularly at the <a href="http://www.planet-rock.com/">local climbing gym</a> in Ann Arbor,  
              progressing until I could climb 5.10 routes.  I climbed outdoors at 
              <a href="http://www.grandledgeclimbing.com/">Grand Ledge, MI</a>, 
              <a href="http://www.redrivergorge.com/climbing.html">Red River Gorge, KY</a>,
              <a href="https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/climbing.htm">New River Gorge, WV</a>, and
              <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/climbing.htm">Joshua Tree National Park, CA</a>.
              My climbing career came to an end in 2001 after a 20 foot fall in a climbing gym,   
              where I sustained a fractured hip and several bulging discs in my lower back.
