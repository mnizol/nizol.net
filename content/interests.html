        <h1>The Game of Go</h1>

        <p>
        I became aware of Go while watching Aronofsky's film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/">Pi</a>.  Go 
        (or weiqi in Chinese, baduk in Korean) is an ancient game of strategy.  Two players 
        alternate placing white and black stones on a 19-by-19 grid with the objective of surrounding as much territory
        on the board as possible.  When a group of stones is completely surrounded by opposing stones, they are captured 
        and removed from the board.  The elegance of Go is in the complex strategy that develops from such simple rules. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Unlike chess, no computer program has yet been written that can challenge the strongest professional players.
        This is partly due to the immense number of possible game states inherent in a 19-by-19 board: exhaustive search by a computer for 
        the best move to make is simply not possible in Go as it is in other board games.  Some have claimed that no two games of 
        Go have ever been identical.
        </p>

        <p>
        Go is most enjoyable played in person with a friend, but there exist many resources to play Go on the computer,
        including <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">Kiseido Go Server</a>, <a href="http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet">Internet Go Server</a>,
        and <a href="https://online-go.com/">Online Go Server</a>.  The 
        <a href="http://www.usgo.org/">American Go Association</a> sponsors local clubs and tournaments, which provides another
        avenue of play.

        <h1>Hiking</h1>

        <p>
        My parents often took my brother and me hiking as children, an activity that I generally found distasteful at the time: I wanted to
        be inside playing video games.  But I'm extremely grateful to them for exposing me to so many experiences as I grew up: nature,
        travel, art, and music.  In particular, after spending my work week in front of a computer screen, it's extremely rejuvenating
        to lose myself in the woods for a while.  Hiking is exercise, but it is more importantly an opportunity to reconnect with the 
        natural world and with myself.  It is a time to be present and notice my surroundings.  I've collected links to a few locations
        where I commonly hike in the vicinity of my home, and some places where I've travelled that have particularly inspired me.

        <h2>Around Southeast Michigan</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.metroparks.com/Kensington-Metropark">Kensington Metropark</a> has a nature study area offering
            hikes of a few miles.  White-tailed deer, chickadees, and cranes are common, and the loop around Wildwing Lake has some rewarding views.  
          </li>          
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.metroparks.com/Indian-Springs-Metropark">Indian Springs Metropark</a> contains the headwaters of the Huron
            River and several miles of enjoyable hiking.  Particularly striking are the large number of ant mounds rising from ground along the 
            trails like cities hugging a river bank.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?type=SPRK&amp;id=438">Brighton State Recreation Area</a> contains a 
            five mile loop through a surprisingly lush and dense forest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?type=SPRK&amp;id=484">Waterloo-Pinckney Recreation Areas</a> are actually 
            two adjacent parks.  There is a 36 mile trail from Waterloo Recreation Area to Pinckney Recreation Area, making this one of the
            only places to go backpacking in southern Michigan.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Further Out</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>
             <a href="http://www.nps.gov/slbe/index.htm">Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore</a> will transform your image of Michigan.  Hiking
             over sand dunes for miles in anticipation of the sight of majestic Lake Michigan is challenging: the summer heat makes this feel like
             an excursion in the desert.  
           </li>
           <li>
             <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> is one of the most beautiful National Parks. 
             From hiking through dense woods to reach serene Rainbow Falls, scrambling over steep boulders to reach the incredible panorama atop Chimney
             Tops, or walking along a ledge only a few feet wide on the Alum Cave Bluffs trail while holding onto a wire bolted into the mountainside,
             the Smoky Mountains are a hiker's paradise.
           </li>   
           <li>
             <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm">Yellowstone National Park</a> is the first National Park and one of the most popular.  The awe one feels at the incredible display of geysers and hot springs dotting the park is matched only by the reward
             of viewing herds of wild bison on a hike in the back country.
           </li>
           <li>
             <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National Park</a> is a gorgeous desert park with beautiful flora (the eponymous 
             Joshua Tree, for example) and massive rocky cliffs which make for superb rock climbing.
